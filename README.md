Welcome to Alanas Project 1

Title of the project:
Guess The Word Game!

Overview:
This Word Guessing Game is a scramble word game. The fun part of this game is the words that the user will be umscrambling are all related to HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I chose this game because I love word scramble and how it keeps the brain stimulated. Even more fun because i'm relating the words to software engineering language.

Game rules:
To play the game, the user will press "Start"
The scambled word will appear on the screen, an empty box is where the user will type in their answer. If correct the next scrambled word will appear on the screen and the user will gain a point. 10 points wins the game! If incorrect the user will get 2 more tries until the game restarts.

User stories:
When I press start, the game comes on. Then the rules of the games will appear. When I press "ready" the first scrambled word will appear and I will type in my answer in the answer box. If correc the next scrambled word will appear, if wrong i will get 2 more chances. I will win if I reach 10 succesful unscrambled words.
